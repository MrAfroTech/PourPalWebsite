    }],
    "requestedTime": "2024-01-15T13:00:00Z",
    "notes": "Customer will call when arriving"
  }
}
```

#### 3. Status Monitoring (Polling-Based)
**Since TouchBistro doesn't provide webhooks:**

```javascript
// Implement polling mechanism
setInterval(async () => {
  const orderStatus = await pollOrderStatus(orderId);
  if (orderStatus.status !== lastKnownStatus) {
    await updateCustomerAndDatabase(orderStatus);
    lastKnownStatus = orderStatus.status;
  }
}, 30000); // Poll every 30 seconds

async function pollOrderStatus(orderId) {
  const response = await fetch(
    `${API_BASE}/orders/${orderId}`,
    { headers: authHeaders }
  );
  return response.json();
}
```

**Status Values:**
- **PENDING** - Order received and queued
- **IN_PROGRESS** - Kitchen is preparing order
- **READY** - Order completed and ready for pickup
- **PICKED_UP** - Customer has collected order
- **CANCELLED** - Order was cancelled

### Integration Challenges & Solutions

#### No Webhook System
**Challenge:** Real-time updates require polling, which can be resource-intensive
**Solution:**
- Implement smart polling intervals (30s for active orders, 5min for older orders)
- Use database triggers to minimize unnecessary API calls
- Implement exponential backoff for failed polls
- Cache order status to reduce duplicate processing

#### Limited Documentation
**Challenge:** Full API documentation only available after partnership approval
**Solution:**
- Begin partnership application early
- Request preliminary documentation during application process
- Schedule technical deep-dive sessions with TouchBistro team
- Plan for discovery phase post-partnership approval

#### SMB Market Considerations
**Challenge:** Smaller restaurants may have inconsistent POS usage patterns
**Solution:**
- Implement robust error handling for offline POS scenarios
- Provide fallback communication methods (SMS/email alerts)
- Design flexible order timing to accommodate varying preparation speeds
- Create merchant training materials for POS best practices

## Technical Architecture

### Unified POS Integration Framework

#### 1. Abstract POS Interface
```javascript
class POSInterface {
  async authenticate() { throw new Error('Not implemented'); }
  async getLocations() { throw new Error('Not implemented'); }
  async getMenu(locationId) { throw new Error('Not implemented'); }
  async createOrder(locationId, orderData) { throw new Error('Not implemented'); }
  async getOrderStatus(orderId) { throw new Error('Not implemented'); }
  async cancelOrder(orderId) { throw new Error('Not implemented'); }
}

class NCRAlohaPOS extends POSInterface {
  // NCR-specific implementation
}

class TouchBistroPOS extends POSInterface {
  // TouchBistro-specific implementation
}
```

#### 2. Order Status Normalization
```javascript
const OrderStatus = {
  RECEIVED: 'received',
  PREPARING: 'preparing', 
  READY: 'ready',
  COMPLETED: 'completed',
  CANCELLED: 'cancelled'
};

// Map vendor-specific statuses to normalized statuses
const statusMappings = {
  ncr: {
    'RECEIVED': OrderStatus.RECEIVED,
    'PREPARING': OrderStatus.PREPARING,
    'READY': OrderStatus.READY,
    'COMPLETED': OrderStatus.COMPLETED,
    'CANCELLED': OrderStatus.CANCELLED
  },
  touchbistro: {
    'PENDING': OrderStatus.RECEIVED,
    'IN_PROGRESS': OrderStatus.PREPARING,
    'READY': OrderStatus.READY,
    'PICKED_UP': OrderStatus.COMPLETED,
    'CANCELLED': OrderStatus.CANCELLED
  }
};
```

#### 3. Database Schema
```sql
-- POS Integration tracking
CREATE TABLE pos_integrations (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  restaurant_id INTEGER REFERENCES restaurants(id),
  pos_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'ncr_aloha', 'touchbistro'
  pos_location_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  api_credentials_encrypted TEXT,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  last_sync_at TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Order tracking across POS systems
CREATE TABLE pos_orders (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  seamless_order_id INTEGER REFERENCES orders(id),
  pos_integration_id INTEGER REFERENCES pos_integrations(id),
  pos_order_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  pos_status VARCHAR(50),
  normalized_status VARCHAR(50),
  estimated_completion_time TIMESTAMP,
  last_status_update TIMESTAMP,
  error_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Error Handling & Resilience

#### 1. Circuit Breaker Pattern
```javascript
class CircuitBreaker {
  constructor(threshold = 5, timeout = 60000) {
    this.threshold = threshold;
    this.timeout = timeout;
    this.failureCount = 0;
    this.state = 'CLOSED'; // CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN
    this.nextAttempt = Date.now();
  }

  async call(operation) {
    if (this.state === 'OPEN') {
      if (Date.now() < this.nextAttempt) {
        throw new Error('Circuit breaker is OPEN');
      }
      this.state = 'HALF_OPEN';
    }

    try {
      const result = await operation();
      this.onSuccess();
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      this.onFailure();
      throw error;
    }
  }

  onSuccess() {
    this.failureCount = 0;
    this.state = 'CLOSED';
  }

  onFailure() {
    this.failureCount++;
    if (this.failureCount >= this.threshold) {
      this.state = 'OPEN';
      this.nextAttempt = Date.now() + this.timeout;
    }
  }
}
```

#### 2. Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff
```javascript
async function retryWithBackoff(operation, maxRetries = 3) {
  for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++) {
    try {
      return await operation();
    } catch (error) {
      if (attempt === maxRetries) throw error;
      
      const delay = Math.min(1000 * Math.pow(2, attempt), 30000);
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
    }
  }
}
```
