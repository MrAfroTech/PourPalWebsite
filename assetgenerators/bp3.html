        <h2>Our Solution</h2>

        <h3>The Problem</h3>

        <p>The hospitality industry, particularly in high-volume venues like bars, nightclubs, and stadiums, faces several critical challenges:</p>

            <li><strong>Order Accuracy Issues:</strong> In loud, crowded environments, miscommunication leads to incorrect orders, wasted product, and customer dissatisfaction.</li>
