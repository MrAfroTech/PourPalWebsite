EZDRINK 60-SECOND PITCH
================================

We've all been there — bar, club, festival. You spend more time in line than enjoying the moment. Or you're at a fair with your family. After a few hours in the hot sun, everyone's tired and sweating. By the time you finally get your order, staff is overwhelmed and quality suffers.

This isn't just bad service — it's a $25 billion problem. Customers abandon lines after 8 minutes. 

Seamless fixes that. We integrate with any POS system, from California to New York, Florida to Maine — from local bars to massive festivals. Customers scan a QR code, order instantly, and skip the line.

The upside is huge. Dropping wait times under 6 minutes could grow the $102 billion industry by 30%. That's $132 billion annually — and $350,000 increase in annual revenue for each venue.

This isn't ONLY about reduced wait times. We're bringing the industry into the 21st Century — one seamless connection at a time.
